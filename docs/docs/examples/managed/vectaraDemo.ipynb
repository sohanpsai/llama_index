    "In this notebook we are going to show how to use [Vectara](https://vectara.com) with LlamaIndex.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Vectara](https://vectara.com/) is the trusted AI Assistant and Agent platform which focuses on enterprise readiness for mission-critical applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Vectara provides an end-to-end managed service for Retrieval Augmented Generation or [RAG](https://vectara.com/grounded-generation/), which includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An integrated API for processing input data, including text extraction from documents and ML-based chunking.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The state-of-the-art [Boomerang](https://vectara.com/how-boomerang-takes-retrieval-augmented-generation-to-the-next-level-via-grounded-generation/) embeddings model. Each text chunk is encoded into a vector embedding using Boomerang, and stored in the Vectara internal knowledge (vector+text) store. Thus, when using Vectara with LlamaIndex you do not need to call a separate embedding model - this happens automatically within the Vectara backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A query service that automatically encodes the query into embeddings and retrieves the most relevant text segmentsthrough [hybrid search](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/search-apis/lexical-matching) and a variety of [reranking](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/api-reference/search-apis/reranking) strategies, including a [multilingual reranker](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/vectara-multi-lingual-reranker), [maximal marginal relevance (MMR) reranker](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/mmr-reranker), [user-defined function reranker](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/user-defined-function-reranker), and a [chain reranker](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/chain-reranker) that provides a way to chain together multiple reranking methods to achieve better control over the reranking, combining the strengths of various reranking methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. An option to create a [generative summary](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/learn/grounded-generation/grounded-generation-overview) with a wide selection of LLM summarizers (including Vectara's [Mockingbird](https://vectara.com/blog/mockingbird-is-a-rag-specific-llm-that-beats-gpt-4-gemini-1-5-pro-in-rag-output-quality/), trained specifically for RAG-based tasks), based on the retrieved documents, including citations.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [Vectara API documentation](https://docs.vectara.com/docs/) for more information on how to use the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main benefits of using Vectara RAG-as-a-service to build your application are:\n",
    "* **Accuracy and Quality**: Vectara provides an end-to-end platform that focuses on eliminating hallucinations, reducing bias, and safeguarding copyright integrity.\n",
    "* **Security**: Vectara's platform provides acess control--protecting against prompt injection attacks--and meets SOC2 and HIPAA compliance.\n",
    "* **Explainability**: Vectara makes it easy to troubleshoot bad results by clearly explaining rephrased queries, LLM prompts, retrieved results, and agent actions."

Risks also involve safety concerns, such as AI systems violating safety regulations, causing harm, and impacting individuals' rights and opportunities. Furthermore, the misuse of AI, like AI-enabled technology for creating non-consensual images, poses significant risks, affecting individuals' lives and well-being. It is crucial to identify and mitigate risks before deployment, prioritize high-impact risks, and ensure that automated systems do not violate safety standards or harm individuals. Stakeholder engagement, transparency, and ongoing monitoring are essential to address these risks effectively.\n",

Additionally, it is crucial to adhere to principles like legality, transparency, and accountability in AI development and usage [2]. Moreover, best practices should be followed to protect against algorithmic discrimination and ensure fairness in all aspects of people's lives [6].

       "\n",
       "**Risks of AI:**\n",
       "- AI systems can produce biased and discriminatory outcomes if they are trained on biased data [1].\n",
       "- The decision-making processes of AI can be opaque, making it difficult to understand how conclusions are reached [1].\n",
       "- There is a lack of public trust and understanding of algorithmic systems, which can lead to skepticism and resistance [1].\n",
       "- AI has the potential to cause harm to individuals, organizations, and society if not properly managed [3].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Benefits of AI:**\n",
       "- AI has the potential to build better and more innovative infrastructure, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness [2].\n",
       "- It can help mitigate risks to the safety and efficacy of various systems, improving overall safety standards [3].\n",
       "- AI holds transformative potential to improve the quality of life, offering advancements in various sectors [4].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Expert Opinions:**\n",
       "- Experts emphasize the need for designing non-discriminatory technology, explainable AI, and fostering human-computer interaction with community participation [1].\n",
       "- Trust should be placed in people rather than technologies, and it is crucial to engage with impacted communities to understand potential harms [1].\n",
       "- Ongoing transparency, value-sensitive and participatory design, and public consultation are necessary for the responsible development of AI [1].\n",
       "\n",
       "**Arguments for and Against:**\n",
       "- Implementing strong safety regulations and measures to address potential harms can enhance innovation in complex technologies [3].\n",
       "- Balancing ownership rights, use rights, and community health, safety, and welfare is critical in the integration of AI technology [2].\n",
       "- Lessons learned from urban planning can inform the development of AI-enabled systems, ensuring they are beneficial and sustainable [2].\n",
